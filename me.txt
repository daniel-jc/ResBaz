Blue trees turn orange
I study psychology
This is a haiku
There aren't four lines in haikus
Or five lines
Or six lines

But where are the lines
In this world so filled with blur
Please help me sit there

Paloma is cool. 
So too is that awesome Dan.
I guess I am too...

This is so pretty
I think we are all awesome
Congratulations!

I am hoping I change it before Dan to make him do some work!
That's mean Rachel! And here I was congratulating us all!

Sorry Dan. :(

Let me make another change so I can practice!
