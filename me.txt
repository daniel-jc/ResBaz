Blue trees turn orange
I study psychology
This is a haiku
There aren't four lines in haikus
Or five lines
Or six lines

But where are the lines
In this world so filled with blur
Please help me sit there

Paloma is cool. 
So too is that awesome Dan.
I guess I am too...

I am hoping I change it before Dan to make him do some work!

Sorry Dan. :(

Lest try make another edit so I can practice!
